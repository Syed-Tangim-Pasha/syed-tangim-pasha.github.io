## About Me

I am Syed Tangim Pasha, currently working as an Adjunct Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB). My primary focus lies in research, particularly in the fields of machine learning, deep learning, affective computing, digital health, and computational well-being. I am actively engaged in various research projects as a Research Assistant (RA) at the Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS) lab, IUB, exploring areas related to human stress disorder and diabetes. My passion for research drives me to contribute to cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence and health informatics, and I constantly seek to expand my knowledge and skills to make meaningful contributions to the scientific community.

## Projects

- **Bangla Poem Dataset [<a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zgmrk5m566/draft?a=e1505a47-eb75-4623-9aef-fa845961114b">Mendeley Data</a>]:** We have collected 2207 poems in 11 different categories, and these poems belong to 41 different writers’ writings. We have collected different categories of poems from the website of <a href="https://banglarkobita.com/">banglarkobita</a>. After collecting poems, we preprocessed our dataset and made our dataset for our research on Bangla poem classification.
- **Online Voting System With Linked List Data Structure [<a href="https://github.com/Syed-Tangim-Pasha/Online-Voting-System">GitHub</a>]:** In this project, I mainly focused on how data privacy is needed for the online voting system. I was using a linked list data structure in the software to track every user vote, and I did this to tell society why we should know about any software before using it.

## Skills

- **Programming:** C, C++, Python, Java, MySQL
- **ML Library:** Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Miscellaneous:** Git, Google Colab, Zotero, Overleaf, LATEX
